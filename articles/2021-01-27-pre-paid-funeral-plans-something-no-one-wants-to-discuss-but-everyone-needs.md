*You’ll have Car insurance, Home insurance and perhaps even Life cover for mortgage protection. These are all just in case cover types. As much as we don’t want to acknowledge it, in the end we’ll all need a funeral. Hopefully it won’t be anytime soon, but even if it is, there are major reasons why arranging your funeral now is so important, we discuss them below...*

14.5 million families* are in such a dire financial situation that they would be unable to pay for funeral costs at short notice, unless the deceased had prearranged their own funeral. 

At the same time, Government Funeral Payments have not kept up with rises in funeral costs and in 2012 the average amount awarded represented just 37% of the costs of a simple funeral.*

You may not have given it much thought, but there are two basic choices in how you can approach your funeral,  

#### **1) Do nothing - leave it as a burden for others**

If you leave it for relatives to sort, your grieving partner or kids will have to arrange and pay for it at the time of your death. A time when you aren’t there to support them and they are at their most raw.

With Funeral costs only ever increasing, it will also cost more at that time than it would if you arranged something today or...

#### **2) Act now - define what you want with a Funeral Plan**

By arranging your funeral plans now, there are so many benefits;

**Lock in the price** - take advantage of the cheapest funeral prices, they’re increasing at double the rate of inflation. This saves your family having to pay higher costs when you die. 

**Remove the burden from loved ones** - by arranging all the details of your funeral ahead of time, your children, partner and family need not worry about anything funeral related. They only need to make one call and your plans are put into action. So no arrangements to organise, no heated discussions and arguments deciding what people think is best and no costs to bear. Allowing them time to grieve and support each other.

### What is a funeral plan?

A funeral plan enables you to pre-plan, pre-design and pre-pay all your end of life services in advance. As mentioned it also allows you to fix the cost at today’s prices and also enables you to specify precisely what funeral you’d wish for, as opposed to leaving your next of kin wondering which send off you would have liked.

You get to define things like readings, venue, the type of coffin, and importantly the choice of cremation or burial. And if you want to make changes at any stage, most providers allow changes to your plan free of charge.

Each person will make diverse choices concerning the end of life service they would wish for, and people wish to fund these purchases in a variety of ways. These decisions are clearly dependent not only on one’s financial situation but frequently based on personal choice, circumstance and lifestyle considerations.

Funerals in the UK can be very expensive, costing several thousand pounds. According to SunLife, funerals make up the largest amount in the total cost of dying. In 2017, the average cost of a funeral was £4,078. With the rising prices of services and commodities, this amount is expected to rise further.

### Why should you pre-pay?

Pre-paying for your funeral using a funeral plan not only takes a weight off of your own shoulders but also makes it easier for those you leave behind. A funeral plan proposes a better financial option than putting money in a savings account to pay for future funeral costs. Since 2004, funeral costs have soared - but interest paid on savings accounts has remained very low. There are a range of funeral plans that can be purchased through a direct payment or through monthly instalments, whichever is more suitable for you.

### Making an agreement about your own funeral

After death the person who is left to arrange your funeral has no legal obligation to follow instructions you have left. There are many examples of arguments between remaining family members who disagree on the type of funeral – even between Cremation and Burial. If you have made advanced plans for your Funeral this can be part of your legal will so there is no doubt your plans will be carried out and there is no reason for disagreement between the loved ones you’ve left behind.

### Talking to loved ones about plans

**Being direct**

This is best for families who are frank with one another and have a pragmatic outlook. Make sure you pick the right time to start the discussion, but also not forcing the conversation right away. Something like: “*I’ve been thinking about my own funeral, starting to plan it and pay for it in advance, so that the responsibility won’t fall on your shoulders. Can we put some time aside to discuss it*?” If you need to speak to more than one person in the family, perhaps organise a family gathering and let everyone know in advance.

**Casual approach**

Approaching the topic in a casual manner may be more appropriate for other families. Taking the opportunity to discuss Funeral Planning if the death of someone else is the topic of conversation, be it someone you know or someone in the news or someone on a TV show or film. Asking an open question like “*would you like to be buried or cremated*” and “*where would you like to be buried*”? This can lead easily into the conversation about planning your own funeral and the opportunity for paying in advance.

**Not an easy conversation** 

Whichever approach you take, it's possible that the conversation could be upsetting. Reassure your loved one that you wanted the conversation because you love them and don’t want them to be burdened in the future. It’s best to have this conversation when you are well, but it's still okay to have the conversation when you are in ill health. Holding the conversation at a time of calm, with no distractions or time restriction is important to help in making a decision about Funeral Planning
