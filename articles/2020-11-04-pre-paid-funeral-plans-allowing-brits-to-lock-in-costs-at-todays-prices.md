Rising costs of funeral plans can be a major concern for the loved ones left behind who have to find a way to pay for arrangements at the time of need. Not only is it an emotional time when a family member or close friend passes away, but the task of trying to juggle organising the funeral whilst considering their personal wishes and sorting out payment of the funeral costs can seem very daunting.

### Why 1.4 Million Brits Have Funeral Plans:

1. Safeguarding families from rising funeral costs by paying today’s prices.
2. It can be difficult to talk about funerals with family and how you’d like things to be arranged.
3. Take the stress away from family members having to plan the funeral during a difficult time.

The average cost of a funeral in the UK is £4,271, however this average cost depends on whether it is a cremation or burial funeral. For a cremation, average costs are around £3,858 while a burial averages £4,975.
