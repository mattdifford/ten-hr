Funeral costs have been escalating at double the rate of inflation for the past 30 years. 

### **How much would your funeral be when you pass...?**

On top of these higher prices, your loved ones would be left to organise things at the worst time possible, when their emotions are that their rawist. 

**They would be left to organise...** 

* Choice of cremation or burial 
* Which songs or hymns to play
* Where to hold the wake
* Paying out for Doctor fees 
* Organising death certificates
* Arranging the whole funeral

**With a funeral plan in place from as little as 64p a day;**

* **All the costs are paid**, regardless of how long you live and what the costs could escalate too - your children donâ€™t have to worry about paying, it's done.
* **All of the arrangements** **sorted**, set out as you intended, less stress and no second guessing on your loved ones or children.
* At the worst time, all of the costs and all of the arranging - down to as much detail as you'd like to provide - is all ready done. Your loved ones would **just** have to make **one phone call** to put your plans in to action. 
* Your loved ones can be left to grieve and remember the good times.
